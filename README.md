# lobster

a discord bot to play music, officially supports youtube, spotify and mp3/mp4-files. everything is handled by
lavaplayer, so for more information check that out.\
shoutout to the lobster gang, where the bot name originated from and this bot originally was planned on being used on. i had big plans for this, but i wanted to focus on something else instead, so i decided to make this public.
